# Bit Rot:
- Data corruption can occur, but strategies like checksumming help cope with it.

# Checksums and Hashes:
- Checksums like CRCs in Communications Networks and hash functions in Data Structures are used to compute values over data for error detection.

# ZFS Filesystem:
- ZFS utilizes Copy-on-Write (CoW) mechanism for updating blocks, ensuring data integrity.

# Implications:
- Atomic, checksummed updates enable data consistency checks, self-repair, snapshots, clones, incremental backups, and deduplication.

# CoW Filesystems:
- ZFS, Btrfs, HAMMER, Bcachefs, and APFS are examples of CoW filesystems with benefits like data integrity and easy upgrades.
