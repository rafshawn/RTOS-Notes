# Chapter 1: Introduction
# What do OS' do?
- Process execution, scheduling
- Inter-process communication
- Hardware I/O
- Hardware abstraction
- Filesystems
- Access control (system, files, memory, devices)
- Accounting

Operating systems mediate software access to resources, whether concrete (disk space, I/O devices) or abstract (time, security)

# "Real-Time" Operating Systems?
- **Predictable** behaviour
- Notable deadlines that need to be met, with clear **priorities** of various tasks
- Tasks are **periodic**

###  Hard real-time ("or else"):
- Has hard deadlines (emphasis on dead)
- *Example*: cars, planes, mars robots, etc.

### Soft real-time ("mostly"):
- Has soft deadlines
	- i.e., deadlines are important (mostly)
	- but slippage is acceptable
	- *Example*: Frame drops in HQ video stream
- *Example*: A/V, transactions, simulation

### Non-real-time
- Everything else!

# Important concepts
- Interrupts
- Memory and I/O interfacing
- Multiprocessing
- Privilege modes
- Virtual memory
	- Virtual and physical addresses
	- Page tables and TLBs

# Chapter 2: Processes
# Processes
- **Memory Allocation**: Running programs need memory for code, global variables (`.bss`), the stack, and the heap.
- **Virtual address**: Address used directly by software
- Processses are *unprivileged*

# Privilege
- **Supervisor mode**: Access to privileged instructions
- **User mode**: No privileged instructions
	- Attempting to execute a privileged instruction fromm user mode results in a *trap* (type of interupt)
- Mode indicated by bits in *status register*
- Mode changes on interrupt handling, system calls, or other traps

# Privilege Rings
- A mechanism represented by layers used to enforce different levels of access and permissions for software components running on a system.
- Represented in numerical values. The lower the number, the higher the privilege.
- Number of rings is dependent on architecture.
- Most common implementation has four rings:
	- **Ring 0**: Kernel Mode
		- Highest privilege level.
		- Unrestricted access to system resources.
		- Can execute privileged instructions.
		- Critical system functions such as memory management, process scheduling, device I/O handling.
	- **Rings 1 & 2**: Reserved
		- Intermediate privilege levels.
		- Could be unused or reserved for future expansion
		- Most commonly used for device drivers, not so common in modern systems.
	- **Ring 3**: User Mode
		- Lowest privilege level.
		- User-space applications run in this ring
		- Process' have limited access to system resources and cannot directly execute privileged instructions.
		- Process' here rely on system calls to request services from kernel. Kernel performs operations on their behalf.

# Unprivileged processes
**System calls**:
- How unprivileged processes perform privileged operations
- Privileged system (*kernel*) code called by unprivileged (*user*) process
- Note called like ordinary functions:
	1. Set arguments (including syscall #) in registers or memory
	2. Invoke interrupt or syscall instruction

# Chapter 3: File Abstractions
# Virtualization
- **Time-sharing**: Each user has the impression of working on a dedicated computer.
- **Virtual memory**: Each process has the impression of a dedicated address space.

# Files*
- An array of bytes that *persist*.
- Can be found via a *path*.
	- Paths can be used to look up files...
	- ...but files and paths change independently
		- file contents can change w/o changing path
		- path can change w/o changing file
- No user-meaningful names.

# Directories
- Set of entries $(n \to i)$
	- $n$: user-meaningful name
	- $i$: file's *inode*
	- **e.g.**: `foo.c`$\to 925551$
- Basically just contains a list (entry name, inode number) of pairs.
- Maps names to *inodes*.
- For each file or directory in a given directory, there is a string and a number in the data blocks(s) of the directory.

### *Example*:
Directory `dir` (inode #5) has three files:
	-  `foo` (inode #12)
	-  `bar` (inode #13)
	-  `foobar` (inode #24)

The on-disk data for `dir` might look like this:
| inum | reclen | strlen | name   |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| 5    | 12     | 2      | .      |
| 2    | 12     | 3      | ..     |
| 12   | 12     | 4      | foo    |
| 13   | 12     | 4      | bar    |
| 24   | 36     | 28     | foobar |

Each directory has two extra entries:
- "dot" `.`: current directory (`dir` in this case).
- "dot-dot" `..`: parent directory (`root` in this case).

# inode
- **index node**: Integer index that names a location on a disk. The true and realest name a file has.
- Data structure that describes the structure that holds the metadata for a given file or directory (length, permissions, location).
- Used to identify files and directories.

# Process File Abstractions
Can use *syscalls* to open, close, read, write, etc.
```c
/* Open or close a file: */
int      open(const char *, int, ...);
int      close(int);
```
```c
/* Sequential reading and writing: */
ssize_t  read(int, void *, size_t);
ssize_t  write(int, const void *, size_t);
````
```c
/* Random reading and writing: */
off_t    lseek(int, off_t, int);
ssize_t  pread(int, void *, size_t, off_t);
ssize_t  pwrite(int, const void *, size_t, off_t);
```
```c
/* Directories and metadata: */
int      mkdir(const char *, mode_t);
int      rename(const char *, const char *);
int      stat(const char *, struct stat *);
int      unlink(const char *);
```

# File I/O SysCalls

### From a process' perspective
- syscalls are C functions.
- files are named by **file descriptors** (e.g., FD 3)

# File Descriptors
- An integer that acts as a reference to open a file within a process.
- Indices into a kernel array.
- Each process has its own file descriptor array
	- i.e., my FD 4 **!=** your FD 4

# Chapter 4: Process Control
# I/O syscalls
```c
/* Open or close a file: */
int     open(const char *path, int oflag, ...);
int     openat(int fd, const char *path, int oflag, ...);
int     close(int fildes);
```
```c
/* Sequential reading and writing: */
ssize_t read(int fildes, void *buf, size_t bytes);
ssize_t write(int fildes, void *buf, size_t bytes);
```
```c
/* Randm reading and writing: */
off_t   lseek(int fildes, off_t offset, int whence);
ssize_t pread(int fildes, void *buf, size_t bytes, off_t offset);
ssize_t pwrite(int fildes, void *buf, size_t bytes, off_t offset);
```
```c
/* Metadata: */
int     ftruncate(int fildes, off_t length);
int     fstat(int fildes, struct stat *buf);
int     stat(const char *, struct stat *);
int     truncate(const char *path, off_t length);
```

# Directory syscalls
```c
/* Directory creation: */
int     mkdir(const char *path, mode_t mode);
int     mkdirat(int fd, const char *path, mode_t mode);
```
```c
/* Moving/removing files in/from directories: */
int     rename(const char *old, const char *new);
int     renameat(int fromfd, const char *from, int tofd, const char *to);
int     unlink(const char *path);
int     unlinkat(int fd, const char *path, int flag);
```
```c
/* Current working directory: */
int     chdir(char *path);
int     fchdir(int fd);
```
```c
/* Directory inspection (used by readdir(3) and friends): */
int     getdirentries(int fd, char *buf, int nbytes, long *basep);
```

# Process Creation
## Two step process:
1. Clone current process
2. Start running new program
	- **`fork(2)`**: Creates a new *child* process with:
		- new process ID (**PID**)
		- same memory contents as parent
		- its own copy of the same file descriptors
		- *Note*: Child's memory may be copied from parent, but much more efficient to create *copy-on-write* mappings to physical memory...
		- ... If either attempts to write to memory, a copy is made so both processes can have their own private copies of the data.
	- **`exec(2)`**: Transforms process into different program:
		- new executable code
		- fresh memory regions
		- **Still the same process**:
			- same PID as parent process
			- same working directory

# Process Termination
## `kill(2)`: Send signal to a process
- `kill(pid_t pid, int sig)`
- Sends a signal `sig` to a process `pid`.
	- Most obvious one is to terminate a process.
- Can be used to check the validity of `pid`.

## Signal Handling
- Allows processes to respont to events or interrupts (signals)
- `sigaction(2)` is used by a process to specify how they want to handle signals.
- Common signals:

| Signal  | Default Action | Description                     |
|---------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| `SIGHUP`  | terminate      | terminal line hangup            |
| `SIGKILL` | terminate      | kill program (can't be handled) |
| `SIGBUS`  | dump core      | bus error                       |
| `SIGSEGV` | dump core      | segmentation violation          |
| `SIGPIPE` | terminate      | write on a pipe with no reader  |
| `SIGTERM` | terminate      | software termination signal     |

## `wait(2)`: Wait for a process to end
- `wait(int *stat_loc)`
- This function suspends execution of its calling process until `stat_loc` information is available for a terminated child process, or a signal is received.
- On return, the `stat_loc` area contains termination information about the process that exited.
- *More*: `man 2 wait`
- Why process ended?

| Test          | Meaning                                 | Results                                        |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `WIFEXITES`   | normal termination via exit(3)          | can retrieve exit status<br>with `WEXITSTATUS` |
| `WIFSIGNALED` | terminated by signal                    | can retrieve signal<br>with `WTERMSIG`         |
| `WIFSTOPPED`  | not actually terminated;<br>restartable | can retrieve signal<br>with `WSTOPSIG`         |

# Chapter 5: Memory Allocation
**Memory Allocation**: Allocating portions of computer's memory to progress or processes for them to use.

# Types of Memory
- **Stack**: Allocations/deallocations managed *implicitly* by the compiler
	- Also called **automatic** memory
	- Data or information that you want to live beyond the call invocation should not be left on the stack.
	- *Example*: Allocating an integer on stack
```c
void func() {
	int x;	// declares an integer on the stack
	...
}
```
- **Heap**: Allocations/deallocations handled *explicitly* by programmer.
	- Provides more challenges to both users and systems.
	- *Example*: Allocating an integer on heap
```c
void func() {
	int *x = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
	...
}
```
Observing the code above, we can point out the following
- Both stack and heap allocation occurs:
	- `int *x`: Compiler makes room for a pointer to an integer.
	- `malloc()`: Program requests space for an integer on the heap.
- The routine retunrs the address of integer (on success, `NULL` on failure), which is then stored on the stack.

## Applications
- **Dynamic Allocation**:
	- Arbitrary sizes
	- Arbitrary lifetimes
- **Allocators**
	- Manage the heap
	- Must be *fast*
	- Must *reclaim* memory

# Memory Allocation API
## `malloc(3), calloc(3), realloc(3)`, etc.
- Allocate $N$ bytes of heap memory.
- Aligned in a way that is can allocate any data type.
- Result: `void*`
- **`malloc()` call**:
	- Pass it a size asking for room on the heap.
	- Success--returns pointer to newly-allocated space.
	- Failure--returns `NULL`.

## `free(3)`
- Releases memory for general use again.
- i.e., frees allocation created via `malloc(), calloc(), etc.`
- No size: must be stored by allocator

# Memory Management
- **Garbage collector**: Mechanism to automatically manage memory used by programs, cleaning and reclaim memory no longer needed by the program.
	- Helps deal with memory leaks or manual memory management.
- **Buffer overflow**: Not allocating enough memory.
- **Uninitialized read**: Can happen when you call `malloc()` properly but forget to fill in values into the data type.
	- i.e., reads data of unknown value from heap.
- **Memory leak**: Essentially forgetting to free memory.
- **Segmentation fault**: Usually refers a program attempting to access a memory location it can't access or forgetting to allocate memory.
- **Dangling pointer**: When a program frees memory before it's finished using it.

# Free-Space Management
- **Free List**:
	- List of ranges of physical memory currently not in use.
	- Data structure used to track unallocated memory.
	- Not necessarily a list.
- **Fragmentation**: When memory is divided into smaller chunks that it becomes difficult to allocate large blocks of memory, even when there is enough free memory.
	- **Internal**: Within blocks
		- Allocated memory blocks larger than actual amount of memory needed by process (excess space).
		- Excess remains unused and can't be allocated by other processes (inefficient memory utilization).
	- **External**: Between blocks
		- Free space gets cut to small pieces.
		- Think of it as physical memory becomes full of little chunks of free space, that it becomes difficult to allocate new segments or grow existing ones.

### Where does memory come from?
- **Userspace answer**: From the kernel
- **Kernel answer**: Self-management of phsical memory

|             |                               |
|------------:|-------------------------------|
| **Buckets** | points into...                |
|   **Zones** | that take from...             |
|    **Kegs** | composed from...              |
|   **Slabs** | located in...                 |
|  **Arenas** | which makes up...             |
| **Submaps** | in a virtual address space... |

# Allocation Strategies
- **Best fit**: Search through free list and find chunks of free memory as big or bigger than the requested size.
	- Return smallest chunk out of the possible candidates.
	- Requires full walk of free list, but one pass is enough.
- **Worst fit**: Opposite of best fit. Find largest chunks.
	- Keeps large free block contiguous.
	- Also requires full walk of free list.
	- Terrible performance and could result in excess fragmentation while still having high overheads.
- **First fit**: Finds first block big enough and returns requested amount ot user.
	- Allows early search termination (i.e., very fast).
	- But pollutes the beginning of free list with small objects.
- **Next fit**: Continuation of first fit, where instead of starting from the beginning, algorithm starts search from where we left off.
	- Keeps an extra pointer to the location last referenced.
	- Similar performance to first fit.

# Allocation Size
## How much memory is needed to store $N$ bytes?
- $N$ bytes + per-allocation header + possible free list entry
- *... and maybe round up?*
- **Exact**: External fragmentation
- **Constant**: Internal fragmentation
- **Balance**: Power of two

# Buddy Allocation
- Divides memory into fixed-size blocks:
	- Divides free space by two until a block big enough to accommodate request is found.
	- Each block is referred to as a "*buddy*"class.
- Allocates memory in powers of two:
	- Free memory is seen as a big space of size $2^N$ (e.g., 4KB, 8KB, 16KB).
	- *Example*: Process requests 10KB, allocator allocates 16KB, the smallest available size.
- Implements splitting and coalescing:
	- When larger block allocated, it's split into smaller blocks if necessary.
	- Conversely, when a lock is deallocated, allocator checks if its busy (adjacent block of same size) is also free. If so, buddies coalesced into larger block.
- **MATH & LOGIC**:
	- if $2^{U-1} \lt s \lt 2^U$, allocate entire block.
	- else, split block into equal buddies until $2^{k-1} \lt s \lt 2^k$
	- coalesce buddies of size $2^{i-1}$ when they become free

# Slab Allocation
- Array of constant-size objects, bitmask of allocations
- Initialize on first allocation
- Freed objects **returned to pool** for **later reuse**
- Not helpful for general (arbitrary-size) allocations

# Chapter 6: Shells
# Shell
- Command interpreter
- Accepts user commands, executes them
	- A UNIX **shell** commonly uses `fork()`, `wait()`, and `exec()` to launch user commands.
- With redirection, pipes, flow control, heredocs, scripting, job control...
	- The separation of fork and exec enables features like **input/output redirection**, **pipes**, etc., without changing anything about the programs being run.

# POSIX Shell
- **POSIX**: Portable Operating System Interface
	- Set of standards specifying the interface between a Unix-like OS and user programs.
- A POSIX shell adheres to POSIX standard for shell syntax, built-in commands, environments variables, and other shell features.
- Provides consistent and portable environment for executing commands, scripting, and interacting with OS.

## Redirection:
- The ability to change where input comes from and where output goes to in a command line.
	- *Example*: `command > output.txt`
	- Redirection achieved with `<`, `>`, and `>>`
- Output `stdout` or `stderr` to a file.
- Done with `dup2(2)`

## Pipes
- Connection between two processes.
	- *Example*: `$ echo "Hello, old friend. | cowsay`
	- `|` character used to represent pipe.
	- `echo "Hello, old friend."` is passed as input to `cowsay`
- Output from one program becomes the input another (one way).
- **`pipe(2)`**: creates a descriptor for reading and one for writing
- **`dup(2)`**: sets up stdout/stdin
- File descriptors inherited across `fork(2)` and `execve(2)`.

## Job Control
- Ability to manage multiple processes running within shell environment.
- Command execution is normally synchronous. Shell waits (`wait(2)`) for completion of the child process
- `&` runs command *in the background*; `Ctrl+Z` moves current command to the background
- built-in `jobs` command lists jobs that can be *foregrounded* with `fg` or killed with `%1` or `%2`
- `Ctrl-C` sends `SIGTERM`

## Environment Variables
- Variables set in shell environment and inherited by child processes.
- Used to store information such as *sysconfig*, *user prefs*, *runtime params*.
- *Examples*:
	- `PATH`: Specifies directories to search for exec files
	- `HOME`: Specifies user home directory
	- `LANG`: Specifies language and locale settings

## Heredocs
- Allows you to pass multiple lines of input into command or script w/o using external file.
	- i.e., can construct a temporary file *in memory*.
- Can be represented using `<<`
- *Example*:
```bash
cat << END
This is line 1
This is line 2
END
```

## Flow Control
- Lets you control execution flow of a script or program based on conditions.
	- Constructs (`for`, `while`)
	- Conditionals (`if`, `case`)
	- and Function Definitions
- Allows you to make decision, repeat actions, and organize execution of commands in a script
	- i.e., sequential conditional execution

## Scripting
- Lots of useful things can be expressed in shell
- Don't want to type same commands repeatedly? Save shell commands in a ***shell script***.
- script **directly executable** with `#!` ("*shebang*")

# Chapter 7: Inter-Process Communication
# Pipes
- Creates unidirectional stream of bytes.
- Can `read(2)` from first FD, `write(2)` to second.
- File descriptors inherited across `fork(2)` and `execve(2)` can be shared across local sockets.
```c
int	pipe(int fildes[2]);
```

# FIFOs
- "Named pipes", where two processes communicate w/ each other by establishing a named channel or pipe.
- Instead of using `|` like pipes, FIFOs exist as file that can be accessed by multiple processes.
	- Like regular files, have permissions and can be created, opened, read, and written by a process.
	- i.e., a pipe that appears in the filesystem instead of just the shell.
- Unidirectional, but can use two FIFOs to achieve bidirectional communication.
- Can be inherited, shared, or opened (`open(2)`).
	- Allows processes to rendezvous within constraints of filesystem permissions

# Sockets
- API used as an endpoint for network communication between two machines/processes over a network.
- Allows simultaneous communication locally or across a network.
- Networking applications:
	- Client-server communication
	- P2P communication
	- Inter-process communication (IPC)

## Local Sockets
```c
// Common:
int     socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
```
```c
// Server side:
int     bind(int s, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
int     listen(int s, int backlog);
int     accept(int s, struct sockaddr * restrict addr, socklen_t * restrict addrlen);
```
```c
// Client side:
int     connect(int s, const struct sockaddr *name, socklen_t namelen);
```

### Why local sockets?
Well... Unlike FIFOs:
```c
ssize_t sendmsg(int s, const struct msghdr *msg, int flags);
ssize_t recvmsg(int s, struct msghdr *msg, int flags);
```
- `struct msghdr` $\to$ `struct cmsghdr`: **ancillary data**
	- **Ancillary data**: additional metadata that can be sent along w/ main data payload.
- ancillary data can include extra information
	- i.e., Allows applications to convey extra information related to transmitted data:
		- File descriptors
		- Access rights
		- etc.
- using local sockets, ability to share data **and files**

In other words...
- Local sockets offer more advanced features, better performance, and flexibility.
- Better suited for IPC scenarios.

# System V IPC
- **Purpose**: Provides a mechanism for communication and synchronization between processes.
- Introduced new local IPC objects:
	- Semaphores
	- Message queues
	- Shared memory
- **Flat numeric namespace**: Each IPC object is identified by a unique int key. This key handles access to IPC object.
	- Like a file descriptor... but not?!
```c
int hopefully_unique = 472593;
key_t key = ftok("/usr/local/share/foo/bar", hopefully_unique);
if (key == -1) { /* ... */ }
```

# System V Semaphores
- **Purpose**: Synchronization mechanism used to control access to shared resources between multiple processes.
- **Semaphores shared by multiple processes**: Typically used to coordinate access to shared resources (files, memory, hardware)
- Work on **arrays of semaphores**
### Operations:
```c
int     semget(key_t key, int nsems, int flag);			// Create new or obtain existing semaphore set
int     semop(int semid, struct sembuf *array, size_t nops);	// Performs semaphore operations on semaphores within a semphore set
int     semctl(int semid, int semnum, int cmd, ...);		// Controls and queries properties of semaphore sets (setting values, deleting sets)
```

# System V Message Queues
- **Purpose**: Queues for sending and receiving **tagged** data
- **Tagged Data**: Identifiers that enable processes to filter and process messages based on tags
- **Usage**:
	- **IPC**: Allow processes to exchange data and coordinate activities in a structured manner
	- **Assynchronous Communication**: Allow processes to send and receive messages independently of each other.

### Operations:
```c
int     msgget(key_t key, int msgflg);		// Create new or obtain existing message queue
int     msgsnd(int msqid, const void *msgp, size_t msgsz, int msgflg);		// Send messages to queue
ssize_t msgrcv(int msqid, void *msgp, size_t msgsz, long msgtyp, int msgflg);	// Receive messages from queue
int     msgctl(int msqid, int cmd, struct msqid_ds *buf);		// Control and manage message queues (delete, retrieve info)
```

# POSIX IPC
- **The Good**: Simple API
	- keys and IDs $\to$ file descriptors; better names

| System V | POSIX                  |
|----------|------------------------|
| `semget` | `sem_open`             |
| `semop`  | `sem_post`, `sem_wait` |
| `msgget` | `mq_open`              |
| `shmat`  | `mmap`                 |

- **The Bad**:
	- Paths look like filesystem paths, **but are not**
	- the following works even if:
		- `int shm = shm_open("/foo/bar/shm.example", /* ... */);`
			- there is no `/foo/bar`
			- there is, but no permission to access
		- `/foo/bar/shm.example` might not necessarily correspond to an actual file path.

# POSIX IPC vs System V IPC
- **For POSIX**:
	- Clear paths better than `ftok(3)`
	- File descriptors better than file-descriptor-like handle
		- Simplifies resource management and more consistent with other file-based operations
- **For SysV**:
	- Semaphore cleanup semantics
		- Clearer or better defined semaphore cleanup semantics compared to POSIX IPC

# POSIX Shared Memory
- FreeBSD *anonymous shared memory* via `SHM_ANON` flag.
	- Allows creation of shared memory region without need for backing files.
- Linux more recently added `memfd_create(2)` syscall.
	- Alternative for creating anonymous shared memory regions.
- Creates shared memory referenced **only** by descriptor.
	- Unlike System V Shared Memory, no associated keys or identifiers.
- Sharing is explicit; risk of namespace race eliminated.
	- Processes must explicitly request access to shared memory region.
- Part of Capsicum security extensions.

# Summary
## Inter-process Communication (IPC)
- Always **explicit**: not by accident!
- Mechanisms:
	- Pipes and FIFOs
	- Sockets
	- SysV and POSIX IPC:
		- Semaphores
		- Message queues
		- Shared memory

# Chapter 8: `init` Systems
# Process Parentage
- Where do new processes come from?
	- New processes are typically  `fork(2)`'ed from a parent proces...
	- ...which can be traced back recursively to an `init` process initiated by the kernel during system boot.
- i.e., process parentage traces back to an `init` process initiated by the kernel.

# System Startup
- The boot process involves firmware, bootloader, kernel, and the `init` system.
	- Power on
	- processor executing ***firmware*** at known address (`[EEP]ROM` connected to a address bus)
	- firmware loads ***bootloader***
	- bootloader loads ***kernel***
	- kernel starts ***`init` system***, responsible for managing system's startup tasks

# `init` System
- `init` plays a crucial role in managing the system's startup and initialisation process.
- The system (typically `PID 1`) serves as the root of the process tree and finishes booting the system by handling tasks:
	- mounts filesystems
	- starts terminal (`tty`) device managers
	- starts network services
	- starts graphical login services
	- etc.

## BSD `init`
- Offers two -user modes for system startup:
	- **Single-user mode**: forks a shell (`/bin/sh`) for troubleshooting purposes.
	- **Multi-user mode**: the *"normal"* system startup
		- forks a shell for `/etc/rc`
			- loads settings from config files (`/etc/defaults/rc.conf`)
			- overrides config (`/etc/rc.conf`)
			- runs scripts from `/etc/rc.d` with `rcorder(8)`
		- starts terminal login services (read `/etc/ttys`: start `getty(8)` $\to$ `login(1)`)

## SysV `init`
- Uses **runlevels** with start/stop scripts for each level:

	| Runlevel | Meaning                |
	|----------|------------------------|
	| 0        | Halt             |
	| 1        | Single user mode |
	| 2        | Default for AIX, SVR3, SVR4 |
	| 3        | Default for Gentoo, HP-UX, Slackware... |
	| 5        | Graphical (X) |
	| 6        | Reboot        |

- Startup scripts are help in `/etc/init.d`, with symbolic links to directories like `/etc/rc.d/rcN.d` indicating services associated with specific runlevels
- Each runlevel has a directory (like `/etc/rc.d/rc4.d`)
	- Symbolic links to scripts in `/etc/init.d`
	- symlink implies services "part of" runlevel
- Can change runlevel: `init 3`. `init 4`. etc.
	- Identifies set differences between runlevels
	- runs `etc/rc.d/rcN.d/foo stop` or `start`

# `launchd`
- A process introduced by Apple in 2005 for Mac OSX 10.4 Tiger
- Replaces `init` and `inetd`
- Listens to network ports listed in `/etc/inetd.conf` and...
- ...starts process to serve requests upon connection
	- Therefore unifying service discovery by name or connection

# `systemd`
- A system and service manager that serves as the core manager for various system components:
	- services
	- sockets
	- mounts
	- timers
	- etc.
- Devekioed starting in 2010 and has been adopted by several Linux distros since 2011
- Incorporates elements of different system components:
	- `init`
	- `inetd`
	- `syslog`
	- `login`
	- `cron`
	- devices
	- networking
	- temporary files
	- boot
	- etc.
- Apparently *hugely controversial*...

# Present Day...
- Today, there are ongoing developments in the realm of `init` systems.
- With alternatives to `systemd` being explored such as...
	- `jobd`
	- `nosh`
	- `OpenRC`
	- `procd`
	- `runit`
	- and `S6`
- The landscape remains dynamic and evolving with new possibilities

# Chapter 9: Kernel Architectures
# Kernel Architectures
## Monolithic Kernels
- An OS architecture where the entire OS is working in kernel space
- Differs from other architectures in that it alone defines a high-level virtual interface over computer hardware
	- Syscalls implement OS services
	- Device drivers can be added as modules
- Some examples:
	- BSD, Linux, Solaris, other UNIX
	- MacOS and Windows (kinda)
	- FreeBSD I/O architecture:
<img src="_resources/FreeBSD.png" width="500"/>

## Some questions...
- What happens when your (user-mode) program dereferences an invalid pointer?
	- Program sent `SIGSEGV`: *segmentation fault*...
	- meaning **no such virtual address**
	- i.e., if unhandled, **terminate**
<img src="_resources/80215aa2ec6d7e08259104dfe89a7475.png" width="250"/>

- i.e., User-mode program errors trigger segmentation faults, handled by the OS kernel
- What might happen if **kernel** code dereferences a bad pointer (e.g., a previously-freed object)?

## Microkernels
- Minimalistic Kernel Design
- Delegates most task to user space processes
- Microkernels like MINIX are popular, possibly embedded in Intel Platform Controller Hub.
- MacOS and Windows NT use hybrid kernel designs (almost micro-kernels).

### Functions:
- Control address spaces (low-level memory management)
- Inter-process Communication (IPC) for message passing
- Handling I/O and interrupts by sending messages to assigned ports.

### Pros:
- *Uniform interfaces* through message passing
- *Extensibility* for easy addition/modification of services
- *Flexibility* to add/remove services as needed
- *Portability* with less hardware-specific code
- *Reliability* as it's easier to get right and restart failing services

### Cons:
- *Performance impact* due to increased message passing

### Windows?
- Windows NT incorporates microkernel elements.
- Components like...
	- Executive
	- Hardware Abstraction Layer
	- device drivers
	- and graphics systems follow microkernel design principles.
- Despite being designed as a microkernel, Windows NT also includes non-microkernel components.

# Instruction Processing
- Typically processes one instruction at a time in a sequential manager
- **Pipelining** used for efficiency by overlapping instruction execution stages
- **Interrupts** may occer at any time, requiring processor to handle them during instruction processing

# Interrupt Handling
- When an interrupt is triggered, hardware disables interrupts to prevent further interruptions.
	- ***Why?*** To prevent further interruptions during handling the current interrupt.
- Hardware saves the *program counter* (**PC**) and *Processor Status Word* (**PSW**) or *Current Program Status Register* (**CPSR**).
	- ***Why?*** To preserve the state of the interrupted process..
	- ...which allows the processor to then resume execution from the correct point after handling the interrupt.
- The processor locates the interrupt handler...
	- ***How?*** By referencing a predefined interrupt vector table.
- ...software saves additional context...
	- ***What?*** such as register values, stack pointers, and other data related to the interrupted process.
	- Essential for maintaining the state of the interrupted process and ensuring seamless transition back to execution.
- ...and upon return, execution resumes.
- Hardware interrupts happen a bit, timer interrupts happen a lot

# Interrupted Interrupts
- Hardware and software steps for handling interrupts effectively
- i.e., if another interrupt comes in...
	- Sequential interrupts wait turn
	- Nested interrupts can interrupt the interrupt

# Chapter 10: Process Models and Scheduling
# Process Information
## Process Image
- Refers to the snapshot of a process' state at a specific point in time
- Contains all necessary information for the process to execute:
	- **User memory**: stack, heap, code segment, `.bss`
	- **Process Control Block (PCB)**: data needed to control the process
	- Assuming VM provides separation *and* swapping
- **Must be (at least partially) loaded in main memory to execute**
- i.e., Process image is essential for OS to control and manage process effectively

## Process Control Block (PCB)
- Contains essential information about a process, including:
	- Registers (program counter, status word, etc.)
	- FPU state
	- Descriptor tables (e.g., IDT -- Interrupt Descriptor Table)
	- Memory pointers to code and data, shared memory blocks
	- Fault handler
	- Flags
	- **Process Identification**: PID, parent, descendants, user
	- **Processor state**: PCB: registers, status word
	- **Process information:**
		- Process information (state, priority, event)
		- Signals and Timers
		- Credentials
		- File descriptors
		- System call vector
- Serves as a data structure that holds all necessary details for the OS to manage and control the process effectively

## Process Creation
<img src="_resources/6780fd782ca70a1ba087bd8689c323cf.png" width="200"/>

1. Building the PCB to store process information
2. Allocate memory for the process to execute
3. Create an execution context (thread) for the process
4. Run the process

## Process Switch
- ***Saves*** context of currently running process into PCB
- ***Updates process*** with new state and accounting information
- ***Moves*** process to appropriate queue (ready, blocked, etc.)
- ***Selects*** another process to continue its execution
- ***Updates MMU***  (Memory Management Unit)
- ***Restores PCB*** of selected process to continue execution
- i.e., allows OS to efficiently manage multiple processes by switching between them to utilise system resources effectively

## Process Termination
<img src="_resources/1ae4bdc2bd35f373701bd55b4de0f82f.png" width="200"/>

Occurs when a process exits due to reasons such as:
- Calling `exit(2)` function
- Receiving a `SIGKILL` signal
- Encountering an *unhandled signal*
- Exceeding resource limits

## Queueing Model
<img src="_resources/cc4aa6da91db1ebcb87a7ec05a867574.png" width="400"/>

Analysis and optimisation of processes waiting to be executed

# Process models
- Progresses from simple to realistic process execution models.

## Two-state model:
- Simplest process model; divides process execution into two states:
	- Running
	- Exit
- In this model, a process is either actively running, or has been terminated.
	<img src="_resources/e95c1c216baee8f65191d24d7a634f4f.png" width="500"/>
	<img src="_resources/acc2f4393391112f4e2335964de58d81.png" width="500"/>

## Five-state model:
<img src="_resources/6e49541faafe50079acd653902e4d938.png" width="600"/>

- **New**: Created but not ready to execute
- **Ready**: Can execute when scheduled by the OS
- **Running** Actively executing
- **Blocked**: Waiting for an event (e.g., I/O completion)
- **Exit**: Terminated but metadata remains in memory

### Process State Transitions
- Defines the movement of a process from one state to another:
	- **Null $\to$ New**: Process creation
	- **New $\to$ Ready**: OS prepared to make process runnable
	- **Ready $\to$ Running**: *Dispatch* ready process to execute
	- **Ready $\to$ Exit**: Terminated by other process (e.g., parent)
	- **Running $\to$ Exit**: Termination
	- **Running $\to$ Ready**:
		- Process has had its time continuously running
		- Higher priority process has become ready -- **preemption**
		- Voluntary yield (e.g., `sleep(3)`, `nanosleep(2)`)
	- **Running $\to$ Blocked**: Process waits for syscall, I/O, etc.
	- **Blocked $\to$ Ready**: Event that process is waiting for occurs
	- **Blocked $\to$ Exit**: As above

## Seven-state model:
<img src="_resources/67e3dcbcd78cf7aa2caade6795dae3cf.png" width="600"/>

- A more detailed representation of process behaviour, including specific conditions and events for transitions between states
- Introduces additional process state transitions:
	- **Ready $\to$ Suspend**: Manual suspension (`SIGSTOP` or `SIGTSTP`)
	- **Suspend $\to$ Ready**: No ready process or suspended process has highest priority
	- **Blocked $\to$ Blocked/Suspend**: Manual suspension (`SIGSTOP` or `SIGTSTP`)
	- **Blocked/Suspend $\to$ Suspend**: Event being waited for occurs
	- **New $\to$ Ready/Suspend**: Depends on available resources
	- **Blocked/Suspend $\to$ Blocked**: Higher priority than any in Ready queue; resources available
	- **Running $\to$ Ready/Suspend**: Pre-empted by Suspended process and memory ended
	- **Any $\to$ Exit**: Termination

# Reasons for suspension:
Lists various reasons for process suspension.

| Reason         | Comment                                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Swapping       | OS needs to release resources for another process      |
| User Request   | e.g., debugging or manual suspension (`Ctrl+Z`)        |
| Timing         | Suspension of periodic process while awaiting next run |
| Parent Request | Debugging, examination, coordination of descendants    |

# Chapter 11: Scheduling
# Scheduling
Deciding which task to assign to a resource at a given time, such as...
- Handling I/O requests
- Transitioning process states
- Selecting processes for execution based on various criteria:
	- **Long-term**: New $\to$ Ready, * $\to$ Exit
	- **Medium-term**: Suspend, Unsuspend
	- **Short-term**: Ready $\to$ Running

<img src="_resources/9ab4b87d40528e3f88299fa13362c5d1.png" width="600"/>

## Long-term Scheduling
- Involves admitting processes to the ready queue
	- **Batch**: Jobs added to batch queue; scheduler decides...
		- When OS can accept new processes
		- Which job to prioritise first
	- **Time-sharing**: Grant until saturation: `fork(2)` bomb
- Transitions processes from *New* to *Ready* state for execution.

## Short-term Scheduling
- Also known as *Dispatcher*
- Chooses a **Ready** process to execute
- Triggers when current process blocks, on an interrupt (I/O or timer), or on a syscall.
- Transitions processes from *Ready* to *Running* state to ensure efficient CPU utilisation

# Criteria
Divided into two categories, focusing on different aspects of performance and efficiency in scheduling:
### System Oriented:
- **Performance**:
	- **Throughput**: Processes/work completed per unit time
	- **Utilisation**: Percentage of time that processor is busy
- **Other**:
	- **Fairness**: Treated the same, absence of starvation
	- **Priorities**: Higher priority first
	- **Balancing resources**: Busy but not overstressed
### User Oriented:
- **Performance**:
	- **Turnaround Time**: Submissions to completion
	- **Response time**: Request to start of response
	- **Deadlines**: Maximize percentage of deadlines met
	- **Predictability**: Runs in same time regardless of load

# Scheduling Policies
- Rules and strategies used to determine which task or process to assign to system resources at any given time
- Scheduling strategies and algorithms applicable to uniprocessor systems without strict real-time constraints:
	- **Selection function**: *What gets to go next*
		- $w:$ time spent in system so far, *waiting*
		- $e:$ time spent in execution so far
		- $s:$ (estimated) total time required by process
	- **Decision mode**: *When selection function is executed*
		- **Preemptive**: OS may preempt running process
		- **Non-preempting**: No such pre-emption

# Scheduling Metrics
- **Service time**: Represents total execution time, $T_s$
- **Turnaround/residence time (TAT)**: Represents total waiting time, $T_r$
	- $T_r = \text{waiting} + T_s$
- **Normalised turnaround time**: Indicates service quality
	- $T_r/T_s$
	- minimum = 1; larger values indicate poorer service.

# Synchronization Granularities
The different levels at which synchronization can occur in a system
- **Independent parallelism**: No explicit synchronization time sharing
- **Coarse-grained**: Involves concurrent processes and message passing in a distributed system
- **Medium-grained**: Includes multitasking within an application thread scheduling
- **Fine-grained**: Involves parallelism in single instruction stream instruction reordering (i.e., with instruction reordering)

# Design Issues
Design issues in scheduling involve...
- assignment of process to processors
- use of multiprogramming on individual processors
- dispatching

## Process Assignment
Assignment of processes can be done in different ways depending on the scheduling method. For example...
- **Static**: Processes permanently assigned to processors (dedicated queue for each professor)
	- **Pros**:
		- Low scheduling overhead
		- Allows group/gang scheduling
	- **Cons**
		- A processor may be idle while others have backlog
- **Dynamic**: Processes scheduled on any available processor
	- **Pros**:
		- Less change of idleness and backlog
	- **Cons**
		- Higher scheduling overhead
	- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Multiple queues, but processes moved between queues to balance load.

### Where is it done?
- **Leader/Follower**: Decisions are mode on one processor
	- **Pros**:
		- Simple
		- Conflict resolution straightforward
	- **Cons**
		- Leader can bottleneck
- **Peer**: Scheduling can happen on any processor
	- **Pros**:
		- Eliminates bottleneck processor
	- **Cons**
		- Complicates OS
		- Must ensure processors don't choose same process
		- Conflicts for resources need to be managed

# Chapter 12: Scheduling Algorithms
# Dispatching Algorithms
Determines task execution order and efficiency

## First Come First Served (FCFS)
- Essentially **FIFO**
- Processes chose from the front of the ready queue in order of arrival
- **Pros**:
	- Better for long processes
- **Cons**:
	- May lead to poor turnaround due to *convoy effect*
	- Not ideal for short processes, as it can cause delays in execution

## Shortest Process Next (SPN)
- Also known as *Shortest Job First (SJF)*
- Selects shortest job in the ready queue for execution
- **Pros**:
	- Optimal average Turnaround Time (TAT) **if all jobs arrive together**...
- **Cons**:
	- ...but risk of starvation for long processes
	- **Assumes** knowledge of job lengths

## Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)
- Pre-emptive version of SPN
- Prioritises process with shortest remaining process time
- **Pros**:
	- Good turnaround time
	- Avoids bias to longer processes
	- Low overhead
- **Cons**:
	- Need estimate of required processing time

## Round Robin
- Also known as time slicing
- FCFS, but with clock based pre-emption
- Each process gets a time slice (quantum) to execute
	- Smaller quantum reduces response time
	- Too small can increase overhead
- Favours processor-bound processes

## Virtual Round Robin
- Involves multiple process queues
- I/O queues feed into auxiliary queue
	- Auxiliary queue is prioritised over ready queue for process execution
- i.e., Helps manage process priorities efficiently in a multi-process environment

## Highest Response Ratio Next
$R = \frac{w+s}{s}$

$w=$ Time spent waiting

$s=$ Expected service time
- Selects the ready process with the largest value of response ratio, $R$
- **Favours shorter jobs**
- Brings longer jobs to the top based on age
- i.e., Helps minimise waiting time by prioritising processes with a higher expected service time

## Fair-Share Scheduling
- Method used in a **multi-user environment**
	- i.e., groups of user processors
	- Ensures each user or process group gets "fair share" of processor time
- Dynamic priority adjustments based on usage within group
- In **Networking**, similar concept applied through *Weighted fair queueing*
- Implemented in Linux with the *Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)* to maintain fairness in resources allocation

# Multiprocessor Scheduling
- Involves managing the execution of multiple processes on a system
- Same algorithms as uniprocessor scheduling
- Multiple queues (or processors) to think about
- *Interestingly*, the choice of scheduling discipline has **less impact** in a multi-processor environment than in a single processor environment
	- **Why?**: In a multi-processor environment, tasks can be distributed across multiple processors (parallel execution).
	- The distribution reduces the impact of the choice as *tasks can be processed concurrently*
	- Conversely, scheduling decisions directly affect the order and timing of task execution in a uniprocessor environment.

## Types of Multiprocessing
- **Loosely Coupled/Distributed**:
	- Independent systems work together on a task
	- Each processor has its own memory, I/O, etc.
- **Functionally Specialised**:
	- Processors dedicated to specific functions
	- Usually controller-peripheral
- **Tightly Coupled**:
	- Processors share memory and communicate closely (one OS)
	- Task integration more integrated

# Threads
- *Lightweight processes* within a program that can execute independently
- Processes own threads
	- There can be 1 thread per process, or many
	- Shares the same memory space and resources
- Can run concurrently to handle multiple tasks simultaneously
	- This is known as ***Multithreading***

## Multithreading
- Allows for parallel execution of tasks.
- Shares the same *process description* and *userspace address space*
- Each thread has:
	- Userspace stack
	- Kernel stack
	- Local variable storage (architecture dependent)

## Thread Events
<img src="_resources/61eabf24e00404eb8824ae38877e25c6.png" width="400"/>

Manages execution and synchronisation of threads in a multi-threaded environment:
- **Spawn**: Creation by another thread
- **Block**: Wait for an event (need not block process)
- **Unblock**: When event occurs
- **Finish**: Termination

# Types of Threads
<img src="_resources/1335c5afc122f858b2fdfab52c572a80.png" width="250"/>

## User-level Threads (ULT)
- Managed by the application without kernel support
- Lightweight and fast to create and manage
- Threads are creating by the process
	- Uses threading library
- Often used in Scientific Computing
- Many languages have ULT support
- **Pros**:
	- No kernel mode switch to thread switch
	- Application specific scheduling
	- OS Independent (portable)
- **Cons**:
	- Blocking syscalls blocks entire process
	- Interprocess multiprocessing not possible

## Kernel-level Threads (KLT)
<img src="_resources/d6c1398c382b17736c60fb25076d08fe.png" width="250"/>

- Managed by the kernel (i.e., the OS)
- Processes create threads via API (`pthreads`)
- Scheduling is handled by kernel
- **Pros**:
	- Overcomes ULT disadvantages
	- More robust
- **Cons**:
	- Slower to create and manage compared to ULT
	- Thread switch requires a mode switch

## Hybrid Threading
<img src="_resources/536be26b96b23c53912b966f07912f95.png" width="250"/>

- Combines *ULT* and *KLT*
	- ULTs mapped to (one or more) KLTs for multiprocessing
- Thread creating done in userspace
- Most scheduling done in userspace
- ***Example***: `libdispatch`

# Chapter 13: Memory Management
# Summary
- Paging partitions virtual and physical memory into fixed-size pages.
- Superpages in x86-64 omit last-level page table for up to 2 MiB pages.
- 64b Intel page table entry allows for bigger virtual addresses.
- Future advancements may include hardware bounds checking for security.

# MMU Goals
- **Relocation** for independence from physical address
	- ***Why?***: Program may not load in the same location every time, swap may no reload to same location..
- **Protection** with hardware checks
- **Sharing** when needed

# Mechanisms
- **Segments**: Variable-length blocks of memory, programmer-visible and controllable
- **Pages**: Fixed-length blocks of memory, invisible to programs
- Mechanisms can be combined

## Segmentation
<img src="_resources/01077e0cc4c8cbe65448898de14e0796-1.png" width="350"/>

- Divide process into unequal size *segments* with different values for *base*, *length*, and *protection*
- Programmer must be aware of maximum segment size
	- e.g., 64 KiB on 8086/8088!
- Introduced in 1960s with systems like Burroughs B5000 and Multics
- Intel 8086/8088 used fixed length, overlapping segments like...
	- **CS**: code segment
	- **DS**: data segment
	- **SS**: stack segment
	- **ES**: extra segment
- x64 architectures simplifies to $CS = DS = SS = ES = 0-2^{64}$
	- FS, GS still work

## Paging
<img src="_resources/9dea76d79704e26f48c7011eb418d0b4-1.png" width="350"/>

- Partition **virtual memory** into fixed-size pages and...
- ...**physical memory** into *frames* of the same size
- Don't need to be stored in contiguous frames

## Important Differences
<img src="_resources/ac2707217e9a9913123a4c5aa1c979a2-1.png" width="350"/>
<img src="_resources/a4eee01b688aa336ce404f84e9bcaa5a-1.png" width="350"/>

**Segmentation VS Paging**
- **Size**:
	- Segments are blocks of memory with variable lengths
	- Pages are fixed length
- **Visibility**:
	- Segments are visible to programs
	- Pages are not

# Chapter 14: Page Tables
# Paging in Practice
- The dominant model for virtual memory
- Some concrete examples from Intel and AMD
	- ARM has similar memory management hardware
- Variations of pages used in different OS' to optimise memory management

# 32b Intel Page Table Entry
<img src="_resources/d0da8c0174fbce63fb5eb75fe9ef91fd.png" width="550"/>

| Bit | Name | Meaning                           |
|-----|------|-----------------------------------|
| 1   | R/W  | Enables writing to page           |
| 2   | U/S  | Marks page supervisor-access-only |
| 5   | A    | Indicates page accessed recently  |
| 6   | D    | Dirty: page modified recently     |

# 64b Intel Page Table Entry:
<img src="_resources/1b8c5d02c585427d22a458bc5053f783.png" width="550"/>

- Supports bigger virtual address
	- **40b or 48b**: no need for > 256 TiB right now
	- **Extensible**: Can accommodate larger virtual address spaces if needed without requiring changes to underlying structure
- XD (execute Disable) for security

# Page Table Size:
- For a system describing 32b of virtual and physical memory with 4 kiB pages and frames
	- The total page size is 4 MiB
	- $\frac{2^{32} B}{2^{12} B/\text{page}} = 2^{30}\text{ pages}$
- Each frame number requires 20b; round up to 32b

## Pages tables on 64b machines
- In the context of 64b machines, a page table would needs to be larger to hold entries for larger virtual and physical address:
	- $\frac{2^{64} B}{2^{12} B/\text{page}} = 2^{52}\text{ pages}$
	- i.e., 4 petapages

# Page Tables in Practice:
<img src="_resources/92f66a2555a71949b9d08792c3ee841a.png" width="450"/>

- In practice, real page tables are not monolithic but structured as multi-level page tables
- Multi-level page tables create trees of pages
	- tables of tables of pages
	- every table **fits in a page**
	- individual tables can be replaced (swapped out)
### Two-level page table
- For paging in 32-bit systems
	- Consists of two levels of tables to map virtual and physical addresses
### One-level page table
- Simpler structure, but not suitable for handling extensive memory mappings
	- Limitations in addressing large memory spaces efficiently
	- Some OS's use variations like *superpages* (BSD), *huge pages* (Linux), or *large pages* (Windows) instead
### Four-level page table
- For paging in 64-bit systems
	- Implemented in systems like AMD'x x86_64 and Intel's IA-32e
	- Workable (more scalable approach to memory management), but pretty indirect
### Superpages in x86-64
- Supports omitting last-level page table, supporting up to $2^{27}$ **2 MiB** pages
	- Enhance performance by reducing number of page table lookups required for address translation (Reduces overhead)
### Super-duper-pages in x86_64
- Supports omitting last two page levels, supporting up to $2^{18}$ **1 GiB** pages
	- Further reduces overhead

# Chapter 15: Page Faults
# Why superpages?
- Used to reduce indirection in table walking...
	- ...which can help decrease frequency of page table access
- Primarily aimed at reducing **TLB pressure**
	- Making memory access more efficient by utliising larger page sizes

# Translation Lookaside Buffer
- Acts as a cache for the page table.
	- Stores recently access virtual-to-physical address translations
- When a memory access is requestion, TLB is checked first to see if translation is already available
	- Helps speed up memory access process
- If required access not found in the TLB, a **a TLB miss**


## TLB Miss
<img src="_resources/13e34ff7785a874ae2a93286f74ac3b4.png" width="250"/>

- Happens when TLB does not contain the required translation for virtual-to-physical address mapping
- When a TLB miss happens, hardware page-table walker or OS must retrieve the translation from the page table
- If no entry in the TLB or the page table, **Page fault**

## Page Fault
<img src="_resources/5e8c3c909bff2340daa9e6ed350e2164.png" width="450"/>

- Page fault handler triggered to handle the above situation by...
	- Populating memory
	- Updating virtual memory mappings
	- Potentially fetching data from secondary storage (disk, network, etc.)
- This process ensures the required data is brought into memory and mapping is establish
	- Done to allow program to continue execution
- **Goal**: Keep page faults to a minimum
	- Page replacement
	- Page fetching
	- Buffering
	- Resident size management
	- etc.

# Page Fetch Strategies
- **Demand paging**: Pages fetches only when needed
	- Initially leads to many page faults, but decreases overtime due to *temporal locality*
- **Prepaging**: Preloads memory by exploiting secondary disk structure
	- One page fault on startup
- **Which one is better?**:
	- Prepaging is generally considered better, as it preloads memory and incurs only one page fault on startup, reducing initial delay in accessing pages.

# Replacement Policies
- *When loading from secondary storage, what should be replaced?*
	- Replacement policies dictate which page or frame should be replaced when a new page needs to be brought into memory
- Consider **frame locking** and R/W, U/S bits.

### Optimal Strategy (Belady's Algorithm):
- Evicts the page that will be used in the future
- Not always achievable due to lack of future knowledge of memory access patterns.

### Least Recently Used (LRU):
- Replaces the least recently accessed page when a new page needs to be brought into memory
- Good for capturing temporal locality
- Almost as good as Belady in minimising page faults
- *However*, requires significant overhead to track usage of pages over time at each memory access

### First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
- Replaces the page that's been in memory the longest when a new page needs to be loaded
- Not a great strategy
	- Some frames loaded early are used often
	- $\therefore$ can result in many page faults
- Does not consider the frequency of page accesses

### Clock Strategy:
- Treats available pages as circular buffer
- Associates a use bit with each page
	- When a page is accessed, set "A" bit
	- When replacement is needed, scan buffer
		- If "A" bit set, clear bit and move on (done by OS)
		- Otherwise, page's frame is replaced
- Better ***Why?***:
	- Protects frequently-used pages efficiently
	- Reduces overhead in replacing unmodified pages
- Can also track dirty bit

# Page Buffering:
- An add-on technique to replacement algorithm
- OS maintains two pools of pages
	- Free, not modified
	- Free, modified
- When a plage is "replaced", it is placed in one of these pools first
- Checks pool first when page requested

# Resident Set Management:
- Managing portion of process' memory physically held in main memory
- VM system decides size of each process:
	- **Small**: Lots of processes, higher page faults
	- **Large**: Few processes, low multiprogramming
- Can be done through different modes of allocation:
	- **Fixed allocation**:
		- Number of frames fixed at process load time
		- Can be equal or proportional allocation
		- Page faults bump a page from the same process
	- **Variable allocation**:
		- Frames per process can vary over time
			- Increase if page fault rate is high
			- Decrease if slow
		- Tracking page fault rates increases overhead by a little

# Cleaning
- Periodically writing out modified pages to ensure the most up-to-date data is stored on disk
- Adds overhead of a page fault, but helps maintain data integrity and consistency
- Essential to ensure modified pages are saved before replacement, preventing data loss or corruption
- **Demand Cleaning**:
	- Write out modifications as pages are replaced
	- Adds to the overhead of a page fault
- **Pre-cleaning**:
	- Periodically write out modified pages
	- Allows us to write out in batches
- Both can be used with page buffering

# Chapter 16: Filesystems
# Recall: Directories
- Set of entries $(n \to i)$
- Basically just contains a list (entry name, inode number) of pairs.
- Maps names to *inodes*.
- For each file or directory in a given directory, there is a string and a number in the data blocks(s) of the directory.
- **Incomplete truth**: All of these points are true, but...
	- Missing details on disk encoding (*Implementation*) and *Authorization*.
		- **Implementation**: How are files and directories actually encoded on disk?
		- **Authorisation**: Who can do what? How is it decided?

# Filesystem
<img src="_resources/2fd8cefdf1ab4751988b024adbe9f336.png" width="400"/>

- Method used by OS to organise and store data
- **High-level Goal**: Store files and directories in *blocks*

# Disk Sectors
- Fixed-sized *sectors* on magnetic disks where data is stored
- Originally addressed by cylinder, head, and sector
	- In 1980s, *Logic Block Access* (LBA) replaced this method
- Disks may have around *512 bytes* in size

# Blocks
- Larger units of data compared to disk sectors
- Typically around *4 kiB* in size
- Logically accessed by index and contain data or metadata
- Stores information in a filesystem such as
	- file contents
	- inodes
	- superblocks

# inodes
- Contain essential informmation about files
	- file size
	- uid/gid/permissions
	- times (creation, modification, acces)
	- "pointers" to data sectors
- Serve as metadata structures in a filesystem to represent files and directories
	- Important for managing file attributes

## inode Indirection
- Process of using pointers in inodes to indirectly access data blocks in a filesystem
	- i.e., exploring file size limits with different levels of indirection.
- **Question**: *In a filesystem that has 512 B sectors and inodes with 12 block poitners, how large can a file be?*
	- A file can be up to $12 \times 512 \text{ B} = 6144 \text{ B}$ in size without indirection
- **Follow-up Question**:
	- *What if we permit indirection via one additional sector?*
		- If indirection is permitted, the file size can be extended to $13 \times 512 \text{ B} = 6656 \text{ B}$
	- *What about via two levels of sectors*
		- By two sectors of indirection, the file size can be further extended

## Sector Structure
- Indirection leads to a hierarchy for large files:
	- inode $\to$ sector $\to$ sectors $\to$ sectors
- Allows for efficient data storage and retrieval by mapping data blocks to specific sectors
- Pointers embedded directly in inodes are used for optimisation, especially for small files
	- Enhance performance and reduce data access overhead

# Directory Entries
- Mapping names to inodes
- Can be stored in blocks
- Lets files and directories be organised by associating file names with their corresponding inode numbers
- **Question**: What data structures might you use to store directory entries? Why?
	- Directory entries can be stored using hash tables or linked lists.
		- **Hash tables**: Orivudes fast lookup times. Suitable for large directories
		- **Linked lists**: Simple and flexible in managing directory entries

# Meta-meta-data
- Information used to keep track of free and allocated inodes and blocks in a filesystem
	- Can be managed through *free lists* or...
	- ...given fixed sizes, *bitmaps*

# Superblock
- Stores essential filesystem information
	- Filesystem size
	- Number of inodes
	- Offset of data blocks
- May have multiple copies for redundancy to enhance reliability of filesystem

# Virtual Filesystem (VFS) Operations
- Generic actions that apply to any filesystem
- Includes operations like `getattr`, `open`, `read`, `write`, `truncate`, etc.
- Provides an object-oriented interface to interact with filesystem
	- Allows applications to perform standard file operations regardless of underlying filesystem type
- **Thought exercise**: *Walk through steps required to open a file, read from it, write to it, and close it*
	- Syscall `open()`
		- Specify file path and access mode
	- Syscall `read()`
		- Read data from opened file into buffer
	- Syscall `write()`
		- Modify file contents by writing data into it
	- Syscall `close()`
		- Release file descriptor and ensure pending changes are saved before closing file

# Page Cache
- Mechanism used to cache disk blocks in memory to improve performance (talking to disks is slow!)
- Reduces the need to frequently access disk
- Caching some blocks makes sense, but number of blocks required is hard to predict.
- Page cacheing stores recently accessed data from files in memory
	- This allows faster retrieval when same data is requested again
- i.e., *Helps minimise latency associated with disk I/O by keeping frequently accessed data readily available in memory*

# Chapter 17: File Permissions
**Authorization:** Protection in Filesystems
# DAC: Discretionary Access Control
- **Organizing principle**:
	- Allows file owners to control access
	- i.e., owners say who gets access to files and directories
- **Major implementations**:
	- Unix permissions
	- Access Control lists (ACLs)

## Unix Permissions
- **Users**:
	- Identified by a numeric *user ID*
	- User-readable names in `/etc/passwd*`
- **Groups**:
	- Numeric *group ID* with names in `/etc/group`
	- Users can be members of multiple groups

### Querying user, group ID
Functions like and retrieve the current user's ID or group ID.
```c
#include <unistd.h>

uid_t	getuid(void);	# Get current user's ID
uid_t	geteuid(void);	# Get effective user ID (user permissions for file access)
gid_t	getgid(void);	# Get current user's group ID
gid_t	getegid(void);	# Get effective group ID (group permissions for file access)
```

### Unix File Permissions
```c
[jon website]$ ls
drwxr-xr-x   4 jon  jon     8B Mar 26  2017 assets
-rw-r--r--   1 jon  jon   948B Jan 26 15:37 config.yaml
drwxr-xr-x   8 jon  jon    10B Feb 13 23:19 content
-rwxr-xr-x   1 jon  jon   271B Jan 13  2017 deploy
drwxr-xr-x   7 jon  jon     9B Jan 22 23:14 layouts
drwxr-xr-x  12 jon  jon    13B Jan 24 16:18 static
```
- **Read, Write, Execute**: Each file has these permissions for each *owner*, *group*, and *other* users
- **Setting Permissions**: File owner can can set permissions with `[f]chmod(2)`

### Changing File Permissions
- **File Mode**: Expressed as an OR'ed bitmask of `S_IRUSR`, `S_IWGRP`, etc.
	- e.g., for *Octal*, `0644` (writable by owner, readable by anyone)
	- Can also be set with `chmod(1)`

### Changing File Group
- Restrict access to specific set of users
- Change which groups has access to a file with `chgrp(1)` or `chgrp(2)`
- Change group's permissions with `chmod(1)` or `chmod(2)`

### Changing File Owner
- File ownerhsip can be modified using `chown(1)` or `chown(2)`
- But, permission issues may arise:
```bash
$ chown alice foo.txt
chown: foo.txt: Operation not permitted
```

### Superuser
- Also known as `root` user with UID 0
- Has extensive privileges to change file ownership and permissions
- Can also mount filesystems, configure devices, load kernel modules, etc., **via system calls** (still user mode!)

### Root-only Programs
- Many tools require root privileges for tasks like...
	- filesystem management
	- package management
	- service control
- often via `sudo(8)`
	- `sudo` stands for **S**uper **U**ser **DO**

<img src="_resources/17184eea0fc022b92f076d4bb0c84b42.png" width="200"/>

- Some programs require `root` privilege to run
- Others must be executable by any user
- Some are both!
- e.g., `login(1)`, `ping(8)`, and even `intel_backlight(1)`

## ACLs: Access Control Lists
- Alternative to discretionary access control
- Provides explicit list of users and groups with independent permissions for each.
- Used for complex authorization on multi-user shared systems
- Implemented in NFSv4, POSIX 1e, Windows/SMB, etc.

<img src="_resources/12d27338eddba1904460711b2a00f01c.png" width="300"/>

# MAC: Mandatory Access Control
- **Organizing principle**:
	- Sys admins define and enforce access policies
	- file owners cannot control or override these policies
- **Major implementations**:
	- Used when users *cannot be fully trusted*
	- Provides higher level of security by restricting access based on predefined rules

## MAC Examples
- **Early motivation**: Processes reading *Top Secret* data cannot write to *Secret* files
- **Later motivation**: Processes reading *low-integrity* data cannot write to (e.g., network input) *high-integrity* files (e.g., sysconfig)
- **Later Application**: Process belonging to one application cannot read or write files belonging to another application

# Capabilities
- Third, orthogonal access control method
- **Unforgeable tokens of authority** that convey specific authorities regarding **specific objects**
- Not permissions or entitlements...
- ...rather, a means of expressing the principle of least authority
- Modifiable with monotonic reduction
- **Language-level Example**: Java references
- **System Example**: File descriptors
	- references are **unforgeable**
	- refer to **specific objects**
	- **NOT** alterable with monotonic reduction
	- **DO NOT** convey **specific authorities** (see `fchmod(2)`)

# Chapter 18: FAT Filesystem
# Why Study FAT?
- Offers unique structure compared to Unix
- Still prevalent in various systems like camera file systems

# File Allocation Table (FAT) Filesystem
<img src="_resources/b3977457fe25e18483fbf053a4cd43fa.png" width="500"/>

- Introduced in 1977, still relevant in 2018
- Uses linked lists for block allocation
- Utilizes FAT for metadata instead of inodes
- Despite limitations, remains widely used
	- Lacks support for hard links and permissions, making it less secure
	- But, it does make it suitable for single-user computers like digital cameras or USB sticks

# Block Structures
<img src="_resources/316253a92e80b779d295bb48a137187f.png" width="350"/>

- Utilizes trees of "indirect" blocks
- Includes directory entries with details like...
	- names
	- dates
	- sizes
	- starting clusters
- Resembles a mix of inodes and directory entries

# Linked Lists of Blocks:
<img src="_resources/93183d2776c5177f4df3a09ed5b8653d.png" width="400"/>

- Simple concept, simple implementation
- Enables arbitrary-length files but lacks random access

## Some problems:
- **Assume list of blocks**:
	- <img src="_resources/71db57702354fc5ca0d65a876d4c6274.png" width="200"/>
	- Accessing third block of file (cluster 6) requires iteration
- **Related question**:
	- <img src="_resources/f483f4cc5e65d16092d213f760557a63.png" width="300"/>
	- Where to store the pointers?

## File Allocation Table
<img src="_resources/cfc00c0444f38083a1750ceb2d90b81e.png" width="300"/>

- *Neat solution to both problems*:
	- FAT stores "next" pointer for each cluster
	- 12b, 16b, or 32b for each 2-32 kiB cluster

# FAT Metadata
- Utilizes FAT instead of inodes
- **Implications**
	- No hard links
	- No permissions in FAT filesystem
- **Design**: (Again) suitable for single-user computers without protection mechanisms

# FAT Name Lookup & Directories
- **FAT Name Lookup**: Root directory entry in cluster 2
	- Hard-coded in FAT12 and FAT16
	- Can be elsewhere in FAT32
- **Directory Entries**: Serialised into data blocks in the FAT filesystem
	- 32 bytes
	- map names to details like...
		- dates
		- times
		- sizes
		- starting cluster
	- Sort of like an inode/dirent crossover

# Chapter 19: CoW Filesystems
# Consider
- What would happen if bits changed in:
	- a data block?
	- an indirect pointer block?
	- an inode?

# Bit Rot
- Data corruption can occur, but strategies like checksumming help cope with it.
- **Coping Strategies**:
	- **Ostrich strategy**: Ignoring the issues and hoping it doesn't happen
	- **Multiple copies of metadata**: Keeping redundant copies of metadata to mitigate data corruption
	- **Checksumming**: Using checksums to detect and correct errors in data to ensure integrity

# Checksums and Hashes
- Used to compute values over data to detect corruption (accidental or malicious)
	- Checksums like **Cyclic Redundacny Checks (CRCs)**...
	- ...and hash functions in Data Structures

# Zettabyte Filesystem (ZFS)
- Features **ZFS Hash Tree**:
	- Incorporates checksum in every block "pointer"
	- Metadata blocks form a *Merkle Tree* for data integrity

# Updating ZFS Blocks: CoW Semantics
- Modifications are never done in place
	- Instead, a new block is created to maintain data integrity
- Utilizes Copy-on-Write (CoW) semantics to update blocks
	- Ensures there is no data inconsistency in original block
	- Replace block pointer in metadata block atomically
	- Allows for atomic updates, data-block checksums for reduplication, and self-healing

## Atomic, checksummed updates
- Ensures data consistency can be verified on every access
- Enables self-repair through mirroring or copies
- Creates snapshots and clones easily
- Incremental backups is also easy
- Redupliation is straightforward

## Trade-offs
- CoW filesystems may be more suitable for certain scenarios:
	- **Servers**: Advantageous indeed!
	- **Desktops**: Might be suitable, but not always necessary
	- **Embedded Systems**: Memory usage may be a concern, as CoW systems often need lots of memory. Alternative should be considered to optimise resource utilisation.

# Some CoW Filesystems
- 2005: ZFS (Solaris, FreeBSD, Linux)
- 2007: Btrfs (Linux)
- 2008: HAMMER (Dragonfly BSD)
- 2017: Bcachefs
- 2017: APFS (iOS, MacOS, WatchOS)
	- **Apple Filesystem**
	- Incorporates CoW semantics
	- Atomic updates
	- Features like snapshots, clones, and backup capabilities
	- Offers data integrity and efficiency for Apple devices with advanced storage management features

# Summary
- CoW filesystems allow
	- Atomic updates
	- Nice cloning, snapshot, and backup
	- With data-block checksums:
		- Reduplication
		- Self-healing

Chapter 20: Network Filesystem

# VFS Layer
- Virtual Filesystem layer provides a common interface for filesystem operations
- Abstracts details with common methods
- Many different implementations of VFS layers in OS'

## Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)
- Allows filesys operations to call back into userspace for implementations
- A common methods for implementing filesystems

# Network Filesystem (NFS) Client
- Sends VOP (Virtual Operations) requests to the server
- Request are services across the network
- Client interacts with NFS server to perform file operations

# Client/Server Communication:
- Commands are fulfilled remotely through remote procedure called (RPCs)
- RPC frameworks like *Java RMI*, *gRPC*, *JSON-RPC*, *CORBA*, and *SOAP* are used for communication
- Communication involves sending requests from the client to the server for processing

# SunRPC
- Protocol for data marshalling, unmarshalling defined in RFC 1831
- Stub functions on the local side convert arguments to network RPC...
- ...while server functions on the remote side converts RPC to actual operations
- Both functions generated via `rpcgen(1)` from Interface Definition Language (IDL)

# NFS RPC Flow
- Connect to SunRPC portmapper (port 111)
- Ask for `mountd` protocol port
- Connect to `mountd` service
- Request access to a named filesystem via NFS RPC

# NFS and Security
- **NVSv3**: Lacks authentication and crypto after mounting
	- granting further access by holding file handles
- **NFSv4**: Designed with universal encryption
	- **System security concerns**: superuser can claim any user ID, requiring additional measures like IPSec

## Chapter 21: I/O Historyu
# Evolution of I/O
- **Direct Processor Control**:
	- CPU issues I/O instructions
	- *Memory-*or *port-mapped*
- **Programmed I/O**:
```c
while STATUS == BUSY:    # wait until device is not busy
    pass
write data to DATA register
write command to COMMAND register
# device starts executing a command
while STATUS == BUSY:    # wait until device is done with your request
    pass
```

## Interrupt-drive I/O
- CPU sends a command to the device and continues with other tasks
- Device rasises an interrupt when done
	- Interrupt handlers manage the completion
- Considered better than Programmed I/O
	- unless some I/O is always ready
- **Limitations**: CPU still *has to do the work* of copying data
- **Performance Improvement Approaches**:
	- **Channel processors**:
		- Acts as separate coprocessors with a reduced instruction set
		- CPU send I/O programs to the channel for execution
		- Still a prevalent I/O model in modern mainframe computing
	- **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**:
		- Simpler solution by copying data directly to memory without CPU intervention
		- CPU instructs device to read or write and provides physical address
		- Reduces bus contention as only DMA and CPU are involved in data transfer (*Efficiency*)

## Discrete bus-connected DMA
<img src="_resources/b479f45a8fdb5bb26a81c8bcea7fcc04.png" width="400"/>

- Acts as an independent coprocesseor
	- like the Intel 8237 in IBM XT
- Connected to the bus separately, providing direct memory access capabilities

## Integrated DMA


- DMA engined is integrated into I/O devices, reducing bus contention
- Enables direct memory access without involving the CPU in data transfer

# IBM PC XT
- **Original Chipset**:
	- Features discrete memory, timer, I/O chips, etc.

## Northbridge/Southbridge
<img src="_resources/27d8f95be14cd0b192335d0cafdfefbf.png" width="250"/>
<img src="_resources/e93df916d3b904481af9902c98a84743.png" width="350"/>

- CPU talks to Northbridge via *front-side bus*
	- For fast I/O operations like memory and graphics
- *Southbridge* manages slower I/O operations
- **The Situation**:
	- Processors by Intel and AMD
	- Chipsets made (or bought) by Acer, ASRock, ASUS, etc.
- **The Problem**
	- CPU Performance hindered by Northbridge
	- LSI advancements led to changes in scale, heading towards the **Integrated Memory Controller**

## Integrated Memory Controller (IMC)
- Integrated into CPUs like AMD Athlon 64 (2003) and Intel Core (2008) to handle memory operations
- Eliminates the need for the Northbridge to manage memory, improving efficiency
- Subsequence Integration of Graphics further streamlined I/O process
	- This lead to the development of **On-die Graphics and Memory**

## On-die Graphics and Memory
<img src="_resources/13bf55f1bd206527684adba1570ca2f6.png" width="250"/>

- CPUs now include on-die memory and graphics components for faster processing
- Remaining resources are directed to Intel *Platform Controller Hub* or AMD *Fusion Controller Hub*

# Hardware Configuration
*How do we connect and configure hardware?*

- **Historical Process**: Earlier configurations involved manual jumper settings and software configurations to avoid conflicts
	- **The Bus**: Allows device to communicate by sharing common backplane with physical connections
		- **Extensible**: Easy to add new hardware without rewiring
		- **Flexible**: Physical arrangement is not important
- **Modern Approach**: Today's hardware configuration utilizes PCI configuration space and ACPI for power management
- **Automation Process**: Advancements have reduced manual settings, with software pushing configurations to hardware, albeit with some plug-and-play challenges

## Historical Process: ISA Bus
- Initially "IBM-compatible" or "XT", later evolved into "Industry Standard Architecture"
- **XT**:
	- 8 data pins
	- 20 address pins
	- Address Enable
	- IO/memory read/write
	- IRQs
	- DMAs
	- Ground/Vcc
	- Clock
	- various other features for I/O operations
- **AT** (Evolution):
	- More data and address bits
	- More IRQs
	- etc.

### ISA Backplane
- **Simplicity**: Electrically straightforward design with exposed memory and port regions to the CPU
- Supported by various vendors
- Can connect devices and share data with the CPU

### Hardware Configuration (Pre-PCi)
- Largely a manual process with jumpers and solder traces
	- done to prevent **Interrupt Requests (IRQ)** and **DMA** conflicts
- Requires sofitware configurations to ensure proper device communication and avoid resource conflicts
- Later, progressed to *plug-and-play* systems, reducing the need for jumpers and manual configs

## PCI: Peripheral Component Interconnect
- Introduced PCI Configuration Space
	- Allows kernel to query device config information
- Allows devices to **request** PCI memory regions, IRQs., etc, with registers

## Modern Approach: PCI Express (PCIe)
- Features **point-to-point** multi-gigabit lanes and data striping
	- Improves data transfer
- Utilizes **packetised** transport for efficient communication between devices

### Modern Hardware Configuration
- PCI configuration space
- **ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface)**:
	- Utilised for advanced configuration and power management
		- Inlcludes processor power states, device control, basic devices, etc.

### Configuring Non-x86 Hardware
- **Finding Hardware**: Locate hardware by compiling addresses into kernel/bootloader or loading a compiled device tree representation

***History of Buses **:
- **x86**: ISA, PCI, AGP, PCIE, USB, FireWire, etc.

# Device Drivers
- **Three Main Parts**
	- Configurations
	- I/O servicing (top)
	- I/O servicing (bottom)
- All parts are very event driven.
