**Memory Allocation**: Allocationg portions of computer's memory to progress or processes for them to use.

# Types of Memory
- **Stack**: Allocations/deallocations managed *implicitly* by the compiler
	- Also called **automatic** memory
	- Data or information that you want to live beyond the call invocation should not be left on the stack.
	- *Example*: Allocating an integer on stack
```c
void func() {
	int x;	// declares an integer on the stack
	...
}
```
- **Heap**: Allocations/deallocations handled *explicitly* by programmer.
	- Provides more challenges to both users and systems.
	- *Example*: Allocating an integer on heap
```c
void func() {
	int *x = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
	...
}
```
Observing the code above, we can point out the following
- Both stack and heap allocation occurs:
	- `int *x`: Compiler makes room for a pointer to an integer.
	- `malloc()`: Program requests space for an integer on the heap.
- The routine retunrs the address of integer (on success, `NULL` on failure), which is then stored on the stack.

## Applications
- **Dynamic Allocation**:
	- Arbitrary sizes
	- Arbitrary lifetimes
- **Allocators**
	- Manage the heap
	- Must be *fast*
	- Must *reclaim* memory

# Memory Allocation API
## `malloc(3), calloc(3), realloc(3)`, etc.
- Allocate $N$ bytes of heap memory.
- Aligned in a way that is can allocate any data type.
- Result: `void*`
- **`malloc()` call**:
	- Pass it a size asking for room on the heap.
	- Success--returns pointer to newly-allocated space.
	- Failure--returns `NULL`.

## `free(3)`
- Releases memory for general use again.
- i.e., frees allocation created via `malloc(), calloc(), etc.`
- No size: must be stored by allocator

# Memory Management
- **Garbage collector**: Mechanism to automatically manage memory used by programs, cleaning and reclaim memory no longer needed by the program.
	- Helps deal with memory leaks or manual memory management.
- **Buffer overflow**: Not allocating enough memory.
- **Uninitialized read**: Can happen when you call `malloc()` properly but forget to fill in values into the data type.
	- i.e., reads data of unknown value from heap.
- **Memory leak**: Essentially forgetting to free memory.
- **Segmentation fault**: Usually refers a program attempting to access a memory location it can't access or forgetting to allocate memory.
- **Dangling pointer**: When a program frees memory before it's finished using it.

# Free-Space Management
- **Free List**:
	- List of ranges of physical memory currently not in use.
	- Data structure used to track unallocated memory.
	- Not necessarily a list.
- **Fragmentation**: When memory is divided into smaller chunks that it becomes difficult to allocate large blocks of memory, even when there is enough free memory.
	- **Internal**: Within blocks
		- Allocated memory blocks larger than actual amount of memory needed by process (excess space).
		- Excess remains unused and can't be allocated by other processes (inefficient memory utilization).
	- **External**: Between blocks
		- Free space gets cut to small pieces.
		- Think of it as physical memory becomes full of little chunks of free space, that it becomes difficult to allocate new segments or grow existing ones.

### Where does memory come from?
- **Userspace answer**: From the kernel
- **Kernel answer**: Self-management of phsical memory

# Allocation Strategies
- **Best fit**: Search through free list and find chunks of free memory as big or bigger than the requested size.
	- Return smallest chunk out of the possible candidates.
	- Requires full walk of free list, but one pass is enough.
- **Worst fit**: Opposite of best fit. Find largest chunks.
	- Keeps large free block contiguous.
	- Also requires full walk of free list.
	- Terrible performance and could result in excess fragmentation while still having high overheads.
- **First fit**: Finds first block big enough and returns requested amount ot user.
	- Allows early search termination (i.e., very fast).
	- But pollutes the beginning of free list with small objects.
- **Next fit**: Continuation of first fit, where instead of starting from the beginning, algorithm starts search from where we left off.
	- Keeps an extra pointer to the location last referenced.
	- Similar performance to first fit.

# Allocation Size
## How much memory is needed to store $N$ bytes?
- $N$ bytes + per-allocation header + possible free list entry
- *... and maybe round up?*
- **Exact**: External fragmentation
- **Constant**: Internal fragmentation
- **Balance**: Power of two

# Buddy Allocation
- Divides memory into fixed-size blocks:
	- Divides free space by two until a block big enough to accommodate request is ofund.
	- Each block is referred to as a "*buddy*"class.
- Allocates memory in powers of two:
	- Free memory is seen as a big space of size $2^N$ (e.g., 4KB, 8KB, 16KB).
	- *Example*: Process requests 10KB, allocator allocates 16KB, the smallest available size.
- Implements splitting and coalescing:
	- When larger block allocated, it's split into smaller blocks if necessary.
	- Conversely, when a lock is deallocated, allocator checks if its budy (adjacent block of same size) is also free. If so, buddies coalesced into larger block.
- **MATH & LOGIC**:
	- if $2^{U-1} \lt s \lt 2^U$, allocate entire block.
	- else, split block into equal buddies until $2^{k-1} \lt s \lt 2^k$
	- coalesce buddies of size $2^{i-1}$ when they become free

# Slab Allocation
- Array of constant-size objects, bitmask of allocations
- Initialize on first allocation
- Freed objects **returned to pool** for **later reuse**
- Not helpful for general (arbitrary-size) allocations
